                    Though not specifically a view/section, as it is the core component of Trento,
                    it is important to understand what they are.

                    The agents are the processes that run in each of the nodes that conform
                    a highly available SAP Applications cluster. On each of these, the agents attempt
                    to discover the role of the node and run a set of checks which result in the
                    recommendations described above in the [Checkers](#checkers).
                    The information that is gathered by them is stored through a distributed KV store
                    and is made visible on the `trento` web UI through the `trento` web UI component.

                    The agents implement the core functionality of trento. They are responsible for
                    the discovery of all the clustered components that are required in order to run
                    highly available SAP Applications. These agents implement discovery for:
                    - Pacemaker
                    - Corosync (soon)
                    - SAP components
                </p>

                    In the hosts overview, the user can get a list of all the hosts that are running
                    the trento agent. For each host it will be possible to check basic information
                    such as the hostname, its IP address, to what cluster it belongs and a list of
                    all the tags that have been set by the discovery mechanisms to classify each
                    host accordingly. 

                    When accessing the details of each host, it will be possible to access in-depth
                    information about the role each host has in the cluster such as the status of the
                    core HDB processes, SAP System ID (SID), etc. Here, the SAP administrator can
                    get a list of potential problems and improvements on the configuration of the
                    host that the discovery mechanisms have found.

                    `SAP System Idenfication` string such as `PRD`, `DEV`, or `QAS`. These are used
                    often to identify productive, development and quality assurance systems.
                    In this view we get an overview of the distribution of each SID, the number of
