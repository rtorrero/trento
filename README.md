# Trento

An open cloud-native web console improving on the life of SAP Applications
administrators.

_Trento is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy.
[...] It is one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, [...]
often ranking highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of
living, and business and job opportunities._ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento))

This project is a reboot of the "SUSE Console for SAP Applications", also known
as the [Blue Horizon for SAP](https://github.com/SUSE/blue-horizon-for-sap)
prototype, which is focused on automated infrastructure deployment and
provisioning for SAP Applications.

As opposed to that first iteration, this new one will focus more on operations
of existing clusters, rather than deploying new one.

# Features

# Requirements
While the `trento` web service component has been tested so far on openSUSE 15.2
and SLES 15 SP2 it should be able to run on most modern Linux distributions.

While the agent could also run in openSUSE, it does not make much sense as it
needs to interact with different components that act as base for SAP applications
which are required to be run in a 
[SLES for SAP](https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/) installation.

## Build dependencies

To build the entire application you will need the following dependencies:

- [`Go`](https://golang.org/) ^1.16
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/es/) ^15.x

## Runtime dependencies

Running the application will require:
  - A running [`consul`](https://www.consul.io/downloads) cluster. 

>We have only tested version `1.9.x` and while it *should* work with any consul agents that implement consul protocol version 3, we can´t guarantee it at the moment.

## Development dependencies

Additionally, for the development we use:
  - [`Mockery`](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) ^2

> See [Development section](#development) for details on how to configure `mockery`
# Installation

This project is in development so, for the time being, you need to clone it and
build it manually:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trento-project/trento.git
cd trento
make build
```

Pre-built binaries will be available soon.

# Running trento

To run trento in our development environment we need at least:
  - Consul agent in server mode
  - Consul agent in client mode
  - Trento agent
  - Trento web server

## Consul

The web application needs one or more agents registered against against 
[Consul](https://consul.io/). A consul server needs to be paired with the 
Trento Web Application.

Each [Trento agent node](##trento-agents) also needs a consul agent started. 
Follow the [Running An Agent](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent#running-an-agent)
more detailed steps for starting it prior running the Trento Agent.

To start the consul agent as server:

```shell
./consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -bind=127.0.0.1 -data-dir=consul-data -ui
```

This will start consul, binding to `127.0.0.1` and use `consul-data` as 
directory to persist data.

Another agent in client mode is also required. For development purposes, to be
able to run both on the same host, we need to bind it to a new `lo` address:

```shell
sudo ip address add 127.0.0.2/32 dev lo
```

Create the directory for the consul agent client:
```shell
mkdir consul.d
```

Now we can start the agent:
```shell
./consul agent -node=test -data-dir=consul-agent-data -bind=127.0.0.2 -client=127.0.0.2 -retry-join=127.0.0.1 -ui -config-dir=./consul.d/test
```


> Production deployments require multiple instances for the consult agents. Be 
> sure to check [consul's deployment guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/deployment-guide#configure-consul-agents)

## Trento agents

The `trento` agents are responsible for discovering HA clusters and reporting their
status to the `consul` servers. The agents need to run in the same system as the HA
tools they are managing / monitoring and running them in isolated environments ( e.g. serverless,
separated containers, ... ) makes little sense as they won't be able as the discovery
mechanisms will not be able to report any usable information.

To start the trento agent:

```shell
./trento agent start -n $name examples/azure-rules.yaml
```

> Note that we are using `azure-rules.yaml` in this example which collect azure
recommendations on cluster settings and state for many HA components. New rules
can be created and tuned to adjust to different requirements.

> See the [Deployment Architecture](./docs/trento-architecture.md) for additional
details.

## Web server

At this point, we can start the web application as follows:

```shell
./trento web serve [flags]
```

The supported flags are as follows:
```shell
  -h, --help          help for serve
      --host string   The host to bind the HTTP service to (default "0.0.0.0")
  -p, --port int      The port for the HTTP service to listen at (default 8080)
```

Additionally, `trento` supports the next Global Flags:

```shell
Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.trento.yaml)
```

# Usage

## Grouping abd filtering the nodes in the wep app

The web app provides the option to filter the systems using the previously 
commented reserved tags. To achieve this, the tags must be stored in the KV storage.

For the time being, `consul` can be use to populate the mentioned tags:
```shell
# To group SAP Systems into Landscapes and Environments, you can do the following,
# from any of the nodes where Trento is running:
export ENV=an-environment-name
export LAND=a-landscape-name
export SID=an-actual-SID
consul kv put trento/v0/environments/$ENV/name $ENV
consul kv put trento/v0/environments/$ENV/landscapes/$LAND/name $LAND
consul kv put trento/v0/environments/$ENV/landscapes/$LAND/sapsystems/$SID/name $SID
```

Each of them must have a json list format. As example: `["land1", "land2"]`.
These entries will be available in the filters on the `/environments` page.

# Development

## Build system

We use GNU Make as a task manager; here are some common targets:

```shell
make # clean, test and build everything

make clean # removes any build artifact
make test # executes all the tests
make fmt # fixes code formatting
make web-assets # invokes the frontend build scripts
make generate # refresh automatically generated code (e.g. static Go mocks)
```

Feel free to peek at the [Makefile](Makefile) to know more.

## Mockery

As stated above, we use [`mockery`](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) for the `generate` target, which in turn is required for the `test` target.
You can install it with `go install github.com/vektra/mockery/v2@latest`.

> **Note**  
> Be sure to add the `mockery` binary to your `$PATH` environment variable so that `make` can find it.

# Support
